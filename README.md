NS-USBloader mobile is Android implementation of the [original NS-USBloader](https://github.com/developersu/ns-usbloader). 

Please note: You will need USB-OTG cable. Otherwise, you'll be charging phone.

### System requirements

* Minimum: Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich)
* Maximum: Android 11
* USB-OTG support / WiFi

### Usage

#### USB

1. Open Awoo Installer/Tinfoil/GoldLeaf v0.5
2. Connect NS to Android device using OTG cable.
3. Allow interaction request. Application opens.
4. Click 'hamburger' menu-button and select application you'd like to use.
5. Select NSP on your device. One-by-one each time clicking on button (I know it's not perfect)
6. Click upload button.

Note: use short usb cable.

#### WiFi

For installation over the Net (Tinfoil):
1. Connect to WiFi
2. Setup 90DNS or whatever you use
3. Open Awoo Installer, select installation over the net
4. Open settings (click 'hamburger' menu-button), enter NS IP you see on the screen

#### Bugs

If you're Samsung owner, it would be better to not rotating your phone during transfer. Or minimizing. Well, on my elder device it causes application failure. But you can try if you're curious, and report/update a bug. Please mention your device model. 

### Other notes

'Status' = 'Uploaded' that appears in the table does not mean that file has been installed. It means that it has been sent to NS without any issues! That's what this app about. 
Handling successful/failed installation is a purpose of the other side application: TinFoil/GoldLeaf v0.5. And they don't provide any feedback interfaces so I can't detect success/failure.
